# Blogging Page Application
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

## Overview
This is a blogging page application where users can create posts, view other users' posts, and update or delete their own posts. Posts can contain images and text. The application offers a user-friendly interface, including authentication, a theme switcher (dark mode and light mode), and a preview feature for images.

The layout is divided into three sections:
1. **Top Navbar**: Contains the application logo and options like `Home`, `All Posts`, `Login`, `Logout`, `Sign Up`, and `Add Post`. The navbar dynamically changes based on the user's login status.
2. **Main Content Area**: Displays the content of different pages based on the selected option.
3. **Bottom Navbar**: Provides additional navigation options.

### Features
- **Authentication**: Users can log in and sign up. The options in the navbar change based on whether the user is logged in or not. Once logged in, users see the options for `Logout` and `Add Post`.
  
- **Home Page**: Displays all posts from all users. Each post includes a preview image (lower quality for faster loading) and a brief description. Clicking on a post navigates to the post details page, where the full image and complete description are displayed.

- **Post Creation**: Users can create a new post by filling out a form with the following fields:
  - **Title**: The title of the post.
  - **Slug**: A unique identifier for the post, automatically generated from the title.
  - **Description**: The content of the post. A rich text editor (TinyMCE) is provided to format the content with features like bold, italic, underline, and text coloring.
  - **Featured Image**: Allows users to upload an image for the post.

- **Post Management**: If a user is the author of a post, they can edit or delete it.

- **All Posts**: Shows all posts created by the logged-in user.

- **Theme Switcher**: Allows users to toggle between dark mode and light mode for a personalized experience.

- **Logout**: Logs the user out and redirects them to the login page.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - **ReactJS**: Used to build the user interface.
  - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For structuring and styling the application.
  - **TinyMCE**: A rich text editor that allows users to format their post descriptions.
  - **HTML-React-Parser**: Converts HTML content generated by the rich text editor into a format that can be rendered on the web page.
  - **React Hook Form**: Used to handle the form and automatically generate slugs for posts. It converts spaces in titles to dashes.
  - **Redux**: For state management throughout the application.

- **Backend**:
  - **Appwrite**: Used for authentication, database management, and other backend services.
